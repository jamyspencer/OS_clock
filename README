Program spawns up to 100 "user" processes, s at a time. The users run for a randomly selected time, requests
permission to terminate via a message queue(sending the time it requested). Once permission is given it 
terminates and a log entry is made that includes the time it requested permission and the time it actually
returned. If the program runs longer than t the main aborts, terminating all users and removing the message 
queue and the system clock.
